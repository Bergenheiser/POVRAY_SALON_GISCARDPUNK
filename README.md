Retro-Futuristic Design & Light Propagation Experiment with POV-Ray
Overview

This project explores retro-futuristic design aesthetics using POV-Ray (Persistence of Vision Raytracer), focusing on visualizing how light propagates within closed environments. By combining geometric shapes, vivid colors, and light manipulation, this project simulates how light interacts with surfaces, reflects, refracts, and casts shadows to create compelling retro-futuristic scenes.

The goal is to study and experiment with the mathematics of light propagation and use POV-Rayâ€™s ray-tracing capabilities to generate scenes that reflect futuristic design sensibilities imagined in the past.
Requirements

    POV-Ray: Make sure to have the latest version of POV-Ray installed. You can download it from here.

    POV-Ray Scene Files: This project contains .pov scene files and corresponding .ini files. These are the main files you will run through POV-Ray to generate your rendered images.
